### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am Amit (pronounced Ah-mi-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine. 
 
 - I digitally decode patient's genetic data toÂ find variants/mistakes that can help clinicians diagnose and/or treat human diseases, particularly rare genetic disorders and hereditary cancers. And therefore, I also like to call myselfÂ a "Human Genome Informaticist". :) 
 
 - Most of my work is in the area of identifying disease associated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV). I integrate cutting-edge methods/tools for the same with our clinical bioinformatics workflows for secondary and tertiary analysis . 
 
 - I have considerable experience as a first author to get research published. I also work on collaborative research projects to help with genetic data analysis. I recently crossed [50 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3gs-sk8AAAAJ&hl=en)! YAY! (Not a whole lot but something to celebrate!)
 
 - My experience also includes analyzing humanÂ RNA-seq data, microbial and plant genetic data. I have also worked on insilico drug designing studies and protein modelling. Overall, I have been using Bioinformatics techniques for over a decade in an effort to improve human health. 
 
 - The human genome is extraordinarily facinating and I am always excited to learn more about it and to improve the genetic data analysis methods!

Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CallVars repository which is based on GATK best practices and uses GATK v.4.1.9 for germline variant detection.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at amit4biotek[at]gmail.com or DM me on Twitter [@IAnalyzeGenomes](https://twitter.com/IAnalyzeGenomes).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC). I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). 

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. However I do know that I have a gene for having a sweet tooth.
