### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am Amit (pronounced Ah-mi-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine where I help build Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based DNA testing assays. I hold a Masters degree (MS) in Bioinformatics from Georgia Tech, USA and a Bachelors degree (BE) in Biotechnology from The Oxford college of Engineering, India. Overall, I have been using Bioinformatics techniques for over a decade now in an effort to improve human health. 
 
 - I digitally decode patient's genetic data toÂ find variants/mistakes that can help clinicians diagnose and/or treat human diseases, particularly rare genetic disorders and hereditary cancers. Most of my work is in the area of identifying disease associated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) by integrating cutting-edge methods/tools with our clinical bioinformatics workflows. And therefore, I also like to call myselfÂ a "Human Genome Informaticist". :) 
 
 - I have considerable experience as a first author to get research published in the area of insilico drug designing and protein modelling. I also work on collaborative research projects to help with genetic data analysis which gets published in reputed journals. I recently crossed [50 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3gs-sk8AAAAJ&hl=en)! YAY! (Not a whole lot but still something to celebrate!)
 
 - My experience from previous roles (Research Assistant at Georgia Tech, Boinformatics Intern at Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University and Bioinformatics Scripter at Monsanto) includes analyzing humanÂ RNA-seq data, microbial and plant genetic data. 
 
 - The human genome is extraordinarily facinating and I am always excited to learn more about it and to improve the genetic data analysis methods!

Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CallVars repository which is based on GATK best practices and uses GATK v.4.1.9 for germline variant detection.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at amit4biotek[at]gmail.com or DM me on Twitter [@IAnalyzeGenomes](https://twitter.com/IAnalyzeGenomes).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC). I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). 

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. However I do know that I have a gene for having a sweet tooth.
