### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§¬ I am Amit (pronounced Ah-mi-th), a bioinformatician digitally analyzing human genomes to improve human health.\
ðŸ§¬ I develop fast, automated, scalable, reproducible and highly accurate genomic data analysis workflows.\
ðŸ§¬ These workflows find mistakes in a persons genome which is ~6 billion bases. It's like finding a needle in a haystack.\
ðŸ§¬ These mistakes can be crucial in predicting a persons disease risk or helping with a patients disease diagnosis/treatment.\
ðŸ§¬ The human genome is extraordinarily fascinating and I am always excited to learn more about it.

ðŸ§¬ ðŸ§¬ Some more details...ðŸ§¬ðŸ§¬  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [CallVars](https://github.com/IAnalyzeGenomes/CallVars) repository. Any feedback is welcome and much appreciated!\
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do [Genomics in the Cloud](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC) and am a member of [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). Iâ€™m also learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based methods for variant detection and interpretation.\
âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. I do know that I carry a gene for having a sweet tooth. \
