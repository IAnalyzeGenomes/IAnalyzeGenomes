### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Amit (pronounced Ah-me-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine. I also like to call myselfÂ "Human Genome Informaticist" that is because ~99.9% of any two person's DNA is identical and my job is to identify remaining ~0.1% of regions in the patient's DNA and more specifically those regions that are responsible for their disease. Thats like finding a needle in a haystack! Simply put, I digitally decode patient's DNA data toÂ find mistakes/erros that can help clinicians diagnose the disease and help them come up with a treatment plan. 

I work to integrate cutting-edge Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods/tools with our clinical bioinformatics workflows for secondary and tertiary analysis to analyze patient's genomic data. Most of my work is in the area of identifying Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV). I also work on collaborative research projects to help with genetic data analysis. I recently crossed 50 citations!Yay! [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3gs-sk8AAAAJ&hl=en)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CallVars repository.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. Do check it out.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do Genomics in the Cloud (GITC). I have recently joined a GITC book club. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA.

In my previous positions 
 - I have worked and published on protein-ligand docking and in silicoÂ drug designing studies.
 - I have worked on building bioinformatics workflows for humanÂ RNA-seq data.
 - I have worked with microbial and plant DNA data.
