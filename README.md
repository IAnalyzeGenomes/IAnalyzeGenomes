### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  ðŸ§¬ I am Amit, a bioinformatician digitally analyzing human genomes to improve human health.
  
  ðŸ§¬ I develop automated, scalable, reproducible and highly accurate genomic data analysis workflows.
  
  ðŸ§¬ These workflows find mistakes in the individual's genome. Its like finding a needle in a haystack. 
  
  ðŸ§¬ These mistakes can be crucial in predicting a personâ€™s disease risk or it can greatly help with a patients disease diagnosis/treatment.
  
  ðŸ§¬ The human genome is extraordinarily fascinating and I am always excited to learn more about it.

Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CallVars repository. Any feedback is welcome and much appreciated!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC). I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). Iâ€™m also learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based methods for variant detection and interpretation.

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. I do know that I have a gene for having a sweet tooth tough.
