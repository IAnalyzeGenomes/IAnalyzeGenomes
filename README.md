### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am Amit (pronounced Ah-me-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine. I digitally decode patient's DNA data (A's, T's, G's and C's) toÂ find mistakes/erros that can help clinicians diagnose/treat their disease.  

 - I also like to call myselfÂ "Human Genome Informaticist" that is because ~99.9% of any two person's DNA is identical and my job is to identify remaining ~0.1% of regions in the patient's DNA and more specifically those regions that are responsible for their disease. 

 - I integrate cutting-edge Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis methods/tools with our clinical bioinformatics workflows for secondary and tertiary analysis. Most of my work is in the area of identifying disease associated Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV). 

 - I have considerable experience as a first author to get research published. I also work on collaborative research projects to help with genetic data analysis. I recently crossed [50 citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3gs-sk8AAAAJ&hl=en)! YAY!

 - In my previous positions I have worked on building bioinformatics workflows for analyzing humanÂ RNA-seq data and also for analyzing microbial and plant genetic data.
 
Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CallVars repository.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. Do check it out.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC). I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). 

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA, but I know I have a gene for having a sweet tooth.
