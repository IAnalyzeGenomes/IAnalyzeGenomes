### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine. I also like to call myselfÂ "The Human Genome Informaticist".Â To put simply, I digitally decode the DNA data (A, T, G and C's) in patient's DNA toÂ find information that can help clinicians with a diagnosis or even treatment.

I work on integrating cutting-edge Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods/tools with our clinical bioinformatics workflows to analyze patient data. Most of my work is in the area of identifying Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) that impact human health.Â 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CallVars repository.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. Do check it out. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: amit4biotek[at]gmail.com or DM on Twitter (@IAnalyzeGenomes)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do Genomics in the Cloud (GITC). I have recently joined a GITC book club. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA.


In my previous positions 
 - I have worked and published on protein-ligand docking and in silicoÂ drug designing studies.
 - I have worked on building bioinformatics workflows for humanÂ RNA-seq data.
 - I have worked with microbial and plant DNA data.
