### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ’¬ About me:
- I am a Bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine. I also like to call myselfÂ "The Human Genome Informaticist".Â 
- To put simply, I digitally decode the data (A, T, G and C's) in patients' DNA toÂ find helpful information that can help clinicians/doctors better treat theirÂ patients.
- I work on integrating cutting-edge Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods/tools with our clinical bioinformatics workflows to analyze patient data.
- Most of my work is in the area of identifying Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV), Insertions and Deletions (InDels) and Copy Number Variations (CNV) that impact human health.Â 

  In my previous positions 
  - I have worked on building bioinformatics workflows for humanÂ RNA-seq data.
  - I have also worked with microbial and plant DNA data.
  - I have worked and published on protein-ligand docking and in silicoÂ drug designing studies.

In short, I am motivated to apply/build/use Bioinformatics methods that improve human health.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CallVars repository.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. Do check out my repository.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. I also enjoy Travelling and good food. I used to restaurant hop with my wife to quence my hunger for good food, now we try to cook restaurant-style food at home. My favourite cuisine is Chinese.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do Genomics in the Cloud (GITC). I have recently joined a GITC book club.
