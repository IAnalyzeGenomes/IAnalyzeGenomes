### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am Amit (pronounced Ah-mi-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine.
 
 - I help build Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based DNA testing methods by developing automated, scalable, reproducible and highly accurate workflows. 
 
 - The workflows decode patient's genetic data toÂ find variants/mistakes that can help in disease diagnosis/treatment or identifying disease risk.
 
 - I hold a Masters degree (MS) in Bioinformatics from Georgia Tech, USA and a Bachelors degree (BE) in Biotechnology from The Oxford college of Engineering, India. 
 
 - I find the human genome extraordinarily facinating and am always excited to learn more about it and to improve the genetic data analysis methods!

Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CallVars repository which is based on GATK best practices for germline variant detection.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for advice with my CallVars repository. Happy to acknowledge any advice that I integrate with my workflow. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at amit4biotek[at]gmail.com or DM me on Twitter [@IAnalyzeGenomes](https://twitter.com/IAnalyzeGenomes).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC) swiftly, accurately and at scale. I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA).   

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based methods for variant detection and interpretation.

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. I do know that I have a gene for having a sweet tooth tough.
