### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am Amit (pronounced Ah-mi-th), a bioinformatician working in a clinical genetics laboratory at Michigan Medicine.
 
 - I develop automated, scalable, reproducible and highly accurate workflows/pipelines that analyze Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. 
 
 - The workflows/pipelines decode genetic data of an individual toÂ find variants/mistakes that can help in their disease diagnosis, treatment or risk prediction.
 
 - I find the human genome extraordinarily facinating and am always excited to learn more about it and the methods that improve its analysis!

Some more details...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CallVars repository which is based on GATK best practices for germline variant detection. Any feedback is welcome and much appreciated!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to do ["Genomics in the Cloud"](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=LXSZSO8B3D7J&dchild=1&keywords=genomics+in+the+cloud&qid=1609662594&s=books&sprefix=genomics+in+%2Caps%2C183&sr=1-1) (GITC). I have recently joined a [GITC book club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA). Iâ€™m also learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based methods for variant detection and interpretation.

âš¡ Fun fact: I soon plan to sequence and analyze my own DNA. I do know that I have a gene for having a sweet tooth tough.
